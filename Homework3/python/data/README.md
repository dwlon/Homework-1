## Data Folder

Use data folder for:
1. Training and Model Development:
- During model development or retraining, you might want to export data to files (e.g., CSV, JSON) to:
  - Test new features or approaches.
  - Share data subsets with other developers or tools.
2. Logs:
- Keeping logs of analysis runs or processing outcomes for traceability.

At the end save the data to database.
